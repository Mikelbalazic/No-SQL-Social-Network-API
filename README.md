# No-SQL-Social-Network-API

In this challenge, we were asked to create the routes for a social media application. The app consists of users, Users, Friends, Thoughts, and Reactions. The user can create a username and update their specific information as well as delete their "account". From here, they can add friends and it is shown through connecting 2 different user ID's. The user can also post thoughts, very similar to a social media post, and write whatever is on their mind. When the friend is made, their friend count will be displayed in JSON format in the given tutorial. The reactions have a similar relationship to thoughts as friends do to users in that you need to get the thought ID and the reaction ID together in order to have their reaction count go up on their specific thought. Reactions would be similar to to the way comments work on someone's post on social media. 

The given video tutorial has no front-end display but it uses insomnia to display the relationships between these 4 user elements and how they interact with one another. It sets an example for how the back-end would behave for a social media application, and simplifies the concepts for better understanding.

Overall, I learned a lot in this challenge and how to utilize mongoDB and mongoose for faster and smoother database creation.
